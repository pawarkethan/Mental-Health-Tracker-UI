## Overview

This system is designed to identify and respond to potential suicide risks in real-time using advanced **machine learning classification** (TF-IDF and Logistic Regression) and **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, integrated with **generative models** (e.g., GitHub Models API with GPT-4, Claude) to provide empathetic, context-aware responses. In addition to AI-based direct support, it offers a **journal** and **mood tracking** feature set for users to record personal reflections and monitor their emotional well-being over time.

---

## Features

- **Automatic Suicide Risk Detection**  
  Uses a **Machine Learning Classification Pipeline (MCP)** with TF-IDF and logistic regression to flag concerning user-generated text.
  
- **Keyword Screening**  
  Real-time filter for suicide/self-harm keywords to initially flag content for review.

- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
  Integration of curated resources and knowledge bases to enhance AI responses with relevant context.

- **Generative AI Support**  
  Empathetic and context-rich conversations powered by **GitHub Models API** with access to GPT-4, Claude, and other state-of-the-art models.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  A **React**-based interface for administrators to:
  - Review flagged messages
  - Escalate urgent cases
  - Annotate conversation histories
  - View mood/journal summaries (according to user consent)

- **Mood & Journal Tracking**  
  Enables users to log daily/weekly moods and maintain private journals with optional **sentiment analysis** and personal progress charts.

- **Compliance & Audit Logging**  
  Facilitates compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA-like requirements for health data).

## System Architecture

1. **FastAPI Backend**  
   - Hosts the classification model, manages user data, handles API routes.  
2. **GitHub Models API Integration**  
   - Powers generative responses using state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 and Claude.  
3. **React Admin Dashboard**  
   - Allows moderators or mental health professionals to review and manage flagged content.  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Scikit-learn, SQLite/PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend:** React, Material-UI  
- **AI APIs:** GitHub Models API (GPT-4, Claude, o1)  
- **Others:** Docker (optional), JWT-based Auth, RESTful Services

## Key Modules

1. **MCP Model**  
   - Preprocessing: Text cleaning & tokenization  
   - Feature Extraction: **TF-IDF**  
   - Classifier: **Logistic Regression**  
   - **Keyword Matching** for initial detection  

2. **Mood & Journal Tracking**  
   - Users can log their **mood** on a daily/weekly schedule (numeric scale, emoji-based, etc.).  
   - A **journal** for personal reflections—can optionally run **sentiment analysis**.  
   - Trend charts to visualize emotional patterns.  

3. **RAG Pipeline**  
   - Combines AI knowledge retrieval with generative models for **context-aware** responses.  
   - Ideal for referencing relevant mental health resources/articles.  

4. **Generative Response Integration**  
   - Uses **GitHub Models API** with GPT-4, Claude, and other advanced models to generate empathetic, context-tuned messages.  
   - Automatic escalation triggers for high-risk user statements.  

5. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Secure login for mental health professionals or moderators.  
   - Flagged messages review, risk assessment, and escalation.  
   - Oversees mood/journal entries (with the user’s permission).  
   - Maintains **audit logs** for compliance.
